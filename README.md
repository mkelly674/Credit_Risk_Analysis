# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose
The give task is simple, run some machine learning algorithms and see which had the more percise and accurate measures for low and high risk loans based on credit. There were 6 that were tested for this task. These were split up between the resampled and ensembled machine learning algorithms. There were 4 resampled algorithms and 2 ensembled algorithms.

## Results
### Resampling
- Random Oversampling

- SMOTE Oversampling

- Undersampling

- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling

### ensemble
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier (brfc)

- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier (eec)
